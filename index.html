			<p class="intro">Gary Francis, captain of the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club, is the creator of an artificial habitat meant to encourage the growth of mussels as changes to the canal’s structure threaten their habitats. These changes are being brought about by the EPA Superfund cleanup.
				
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				Many of the canal's mussels lived on the wooden bulkheads that reinforced the banks before the Superfund cleanup began. But the EPA has started to replace the wooden bulkheads with stronger steel ones. While steel bulkheads provide the canal with greater reinforcement, the replacement destroys the mussels’ habitats, as the smooth surface of the steel is uninhabitable compared to the porous texture of wood.
			</p>

			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				Francis started installing test models in the canal as early as 2019 and has since been experimenting with a variety of materials and installation methods. The final habitat modules are mostly made of concrete, which offers optimal texture and longevity. The habitats sit on steel shelves hung from the bulkheads.
